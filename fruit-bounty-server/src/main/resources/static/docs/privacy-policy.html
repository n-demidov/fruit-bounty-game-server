  <h4>
    What we collect
  </h4>
  <p>
    First of all, the main aim of collecting personal data is to help us improve the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we collect Personal Information. By Personal Information, we mean data that identify you, such as name, address, telephone number, social security number, email, etc. We will not ask for all these data. We harvest these data from Facebook.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Facebook:</em> When you access the Game through Facebook, we may receive your basic account information (user ID, name, email, gender, birthday, current city, profile picture URL, and the user IDs of the user’s friends who have also connected with your application) from Facebook and You.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note again, that we abide by Facebook rules that manage the use of personal data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>You:</em> You may want to share additional information with us. In that case, we may use the information you voluntarily give to us. We will not collect any personal data, except name and email.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    We also collect non-Personal Information. By non-Personal Information, we mean data that cannot identify you. Non-Personal Information can be linked to the game (score, length of playing, activities, …) or to the general use ( Internet Protocol Addresses, Browser type, Browser Language, referring and exit URLs, number of clicks…).
  </p>
  <p>
    We may use generated user content. This is the content you can publish through the game and that is visible by everyone (posts wall, sent messages, actions with other players,…). Please note, that if you post Personal Information on things like comment or wall, we cannot guarantee the protection of your information. So, be careful of the content you publish on public domain. We cannot guarantee the use of this information.

  <h4>
    How we use collected data
  </h4>
  <p>
    Again, the aim of harvesting data is the improvement of our game.
  </p>
  <p>
    We abide by Facebook rules concerning the use of data. So we will never share/sell/rent/transfer any Personal Information about you to any third party without your consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use the collected information to improve the quality of our game. We use the statistics that we have, thanks to your Personal and non-Personal Information, to establish profiles of our gamers. Like that, the game evolves in the best way to fit with people’s wishes. In fact, it helps us to understand who plays the most and why and to adapt the game to provide the content people really like to view.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will also use collected data to technically manage the application. For example, we may log your IP addresses to monitor the traffic. We will never disclose your IP to a third party.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personal Information allows us to contact you, if we need to. It allows us to send you notifications. If you do not want to receive further notifications from us, you can opt out at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may provide us email addresses of your friends to invite them to the game. We keep these addresses for a while to contact them and remind them that they have been invited to the application. They can opt not to receive further mail from us, at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may disclose or access data about you if the law requires it (subpoena, court order, …) or if we have a good faith belief that it will avoid liability or fraud or to comply with legal process. This includes sharing data with companies or governments. We do not have to question such governmental process.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Transfer
  </h4>
  <p>
